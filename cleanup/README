 What is it?
----------------------------------------
This program is a free model viewer for Quake 3's MD3 file
format, programmed in C++.

The demo need the path to a directory containing a player
model (upper.md3, lower.md3, head.md3 and associated textures)
as first parameter, and the path to a directory containing a
weapon (optional).

You can also pass a *.md3 file as parameter,
the program will try to load a player in the directory
in which it is.

For example, the following command:

   ./OpenGLMD3Loader models/players/harley

will load the player from the models/players/harley directory,
and the command:

   ./OpenGLMD3Loader models/players/harley models/weapons2/plasma

will load the player and a weapon.

Under Windows, you can drag and drop a directory onto the
OpenGLMD3Loader.exe, or open a *.md3 file with the
"open with..." menu.


 Notes
----------------------------------------
 * this program uses the GLUT library.
 * uses a texture manager which support TGA and JPEG image formats.
 * source code has been compiled under GNU/Linux with GCC 4.1.1
   and under Windows with MinGW 3.4.2.
 * source code is licenced under the MIT licence.
 * requires the boost library for compiling the source.


 Endianess issues
----------------------------------------
This demo only works on little endian architectures, since the
MD2 format is a binary file format stored in little endian order.
The program doesn't convert file data in big endian, althrough it
wouldn't be difficult to implement.
